	    <h1>About Us</h1>
	    <p>Gadgets Guide is a review site established in 2021, owned and maintained by some tech enthusiastic. Our team believes in true and honest reviews that will help any consumer, savvy or not, make the right purchase. Every tech product released newly are reviewed by our team and ranked daily on the basis of different criteria which are based on the user experiences and perferences.</p>
	    <h3>What's our site for?</h3>
	    <p>Our site is a review site focusing on tech products. A review site is a website on which reviews can be posted about people, businesses, products, or services.</p>
	    <h3>Why should you review products before buying?</h3>
	    <p>Online reviews give power to the customers to tell their side of the buying story . This provides social proof to other potential customers. Social proof is the level of credibility that the public provides to a service or product. The more people that use, or enjoy a product, the more likely others are to follow.</p>
	    <h3>How can you trust our reviews?</h3>
	    <p>All the products are reviewed by two main approaches. Firstly, we do intense research on the product about the claims they make about the product to check whether its true or not. We never reccommended a prouct just beacuse of the advertisements they make or the hype around it. On the other hand, we buy the product and check it manually. Sometimes we do the both ways to ensure that our reviews are best for the customers.<p>
